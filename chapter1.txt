1. first create a folder 
2. open terminal in that directory
3. run git init
4. git will initialise an empty directory.(corrected the spelling here)
5. create a file using touch command e.g touch page1.txt
6. use vim or nano to add some text into it
7. then run git status command to see what changes have been done so far.

8. run git add . to add all the untracked files to staging area or  for particular file run git add page1.txt
9. git status to see if the changes that are added to stage are on stage or not.
10. if you have add unnecessary files to stage you can unstage it by running this command. git rm --cached <file>.
10.1. you can also run git restore --staged page1.txt to move unstaged changes.

11. to save or take a picture of the moment at that point we use commit command as. git commit -m "page1.txt file added".
11.1. after running git log press q to exit the running git log service..

12. to delete a particular commit it is not possible. if you want to del a particular commit all commits done after that will also get deleted. to that first do git log, then copy the hash code of commit that you want to go to after that all commits will be get deleted. run git reset <commit hash>

13. To push you local project to github, first you create a remote repository it will create a url then you have to connect that url with you local repo.
git remote add origin <url>
in this above command remote means we are adding url add means associating origin is the name of url, kind of contact name associate to phone no.

14. all the repositories in your personal account has a url associate with origin.
you can run git remote -v to find all the url associated with the current folder

15. Now we cannot see the files in remote repo in git hub because we have only connected the local repo with the url to share files we have to run git push origin master command. her push is to share and origin is the url to push to and master is the branch im which branch to push.
